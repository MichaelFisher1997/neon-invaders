# Monetization Roadmap

## Vision
Adopt a cosmetic-first revenue model with optional progression boosts, avoiding pay-to-win while keeping long-term engagement high.

## Workstreams
1. **Cosmetic Pipeline**
   - Expand cosmetics catalog (ship skins, bullet/explosion VFX, HUD themes).
   - Build unlock UI for premium bundles and time-limited events.
   - Implement gifting/promotional codes for influencers and events.

2. **Premium Currency & Bundles**
   - Introduce a purchasable “Neon Shards” currency separate from credits.
   - Offer shard bundles at standard price points ($1.99–$19.99) with regional pricing.
   - Provide shard sinks: exclusive cosmetics, limited rotating shop, optional credit boosters.

3. **Optional Boosters**
   - Design temporary credit multipliers (e.g., 2x for 30 minutes) purchasable via shards or ad views.
   - Ensure boosts don’t trivialize progression; cap stacking and communicate effects clearly.

4. **Live Ops & Seasonal Content**
   - Plan themed seasons (~6 weeks) with unique cosmetics, challenges, and leaderboard rewards.
   - Rotate special alien variants or wave modifiers to increase engagement.
   - Integrate analytics to monitor conversion, retention, and player sentiment.

5. **Compliance & Payments**
   - Integrate with platform stores (Steam DLC, mobile IAP) respecting platform guidelines.
   - Implement parental controls, refund support, and GDPR-compliant data handling.

## Milestones
- **MVP Shop:** Credit-only cosmetics, soft launch telemetry (Month 1).
- **Premium Launch:** Shard currency, starter bundles, limited skins (Month 2).
- **Season 1:** Live ops cadence, booster experiments, community events (Month 3).

## Success Metrics
- Cosmetic attach rate ≥ 5% of MAU.
- Retention uplift (D30 +5%) from seasonal content.
- Booster/IAP revenue ≤ 30% of total (to keep cosmetics primary).
